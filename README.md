### NTS Track Scraper

A tool created to help me scrape tracks off NTS sets, so I can look them up myself more easily myself. Currently only scrapes the Acid + Techno genres (I really love acid techno), once it is in a shape I am satisfied with, I will add the ability to choose genres with command line arguments.

# Usage

At the moment, just run ```go run .```, and it'll scrape the first page of recent acid techno NTS sets, output as a JSON file.
